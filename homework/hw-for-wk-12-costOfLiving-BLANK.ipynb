    "Each year the U.S. government increases the amount of social security retired people receive. That increase is based on the annual inflation rate  and the political climate (or party in control). I have indexed the numbers so 1995 is 100, and each year after that the number reflects a percentage increase since 1995. So between 1995 at 100 and 1996 at 102.6 reflects a 2.6 percent increase. And between 1995 and 1997 reflects a 5.6 percent increase.\n",
